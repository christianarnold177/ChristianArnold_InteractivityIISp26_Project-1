 <p>When I was going into college, I was questioning what I wanted to do during my time here at the University of North Carolina Greensboro.
 When I chose Art, it changed my life in college by giving me a new way to understand myself. At first, during my first semester, I only saw
 art mostly as assignments and requirements rather than something personal. Since then, creating and studying art helped me slow down and pay attention
 to my thoughts and emotions. Art became a space where I could reflect without feeling pressured to be "right." This shift helped me feel more
 confident expressing who I am.
