   font-style: normal;">Finding Balance Through Creativity</h2>
 <p>When I was going into college, I was questioning what I wanted to do during my time here at the University of North Carolina Greensboro.
 When I chose art, it changed my life in college by giving me a new way to understand myself. At first, during my first semester, I only saw
 art mostly as assignments and requirements rather than something personal. Since then, creating and studying art helped me slow down and pay attention
 to my thoughts and emotions. Art became a space where I could reflect without feeling pressured to be "right." This shift helped me feel more
 confident expressing who I am.

   font-style: normal;">Seeing Beyond Right and Wrong</h2>
 <p>Through college art classes, I learned to think differently and more critically. Art taught me that there is rarely only one correct answer, and that 
 interpretations can exist at the same time. This way of thinking carried over into my other classes and daily decisions, where I was able to consider other
 possiblities in what I viewed in my daily life, whether's its problem solving or managing my schedule. I became more comfortable asking questions and challenging 
 assumptions, especially if I see different ideas that could a project better. Art helped me see problems as opportunities for creativity instead of obstacles, and
 hopefully I can continue to apply those to anything that I see in the future.

 <p>Art has also given me a healthy and productive way to cope with stress and pressure. During each semester, their filled with heavy workloads, deadlines, and
 academic expectations, making art became a grounding practice that allowed me to slow down and focus. Anytime I was sketching, designing, or working through a
 project for my classes, the act of creating helped me clear my mind and release tension, allowing me to block the outside noise and focus on what was in front of
 me. This allowed me to find space to process emotions that were difficult to express verbally. Because of this, I learned to see creativity not just as an academic
 skill, but as an important tool for maintaining my mental and emotional well-being.

   font-style: normal;">Speaking Through Line and Shadow</h2>
 <p>Art allowed me to strengthen my ability to communicate ideas visually, which is reflected in the drawing of the charcoal building I made during my first semester
 at UNCG. This was made during the last week of classes that semester, and it taught me that effective communication doesn't rely solely on color or detailed realism,
 but instead on the intentional use of line, contrast, and value. By simplifying the structure of the building and focusing on shadow and form, I learned how to guide
 the viewer's eye and create a specific mood. The loose, expressive marks I used helped the drawing feel more atmospheric rather than rigid. Through this process, I
 gained a deeper understanding of how subtle visual choices can communicate meaning just as powerfully as words can.

   font-style: normal;">Building Meaning Through Experimentation</h2>
 <p>I was able to understand the importance of experimentation, collaboration, and embracing imperfection during my time as an art major, which you can see in the inventive 
 space collage I made during my Intermidiate Drawing class. Using materials like colored paper, magazines, and envelopes, I was able to layer theminto textures that would 
 allow the viewer to identify each object displayed in the college. This project allowed me to let go of control and trust the creative process without any second thought. 
 The overlapping shapes and mixed materials represent how different ideas and perspectives can coexist within a piece of art, especially if dealing with space. I was challenged 
 to think beyond traditional materials and approaches when making this collage, in doing so, I was able to craft something that's normally outside of my comfort zone. Ultimately, 
 I learned that creativity often comes from taking risks and allowing unexpected outcomes to shape the final result.

   font-style: normal;">Growth Within Pattern and Chaos</h2>
 <p>Majoring in art encouraged my to find personal growth and self-discovery, as shown in the digital artwork I made while I was in Foundations of New Media and Design II 
 called the "Jungle Composition." This was made using Adobe Illstrator, taking nature-like shapes from different images I found and drawing over them to make different shapes,
 and then layering them over each other to create a composition. The repeated organic shapes, layered greens, and rhythmic patterns symbolize movement, complexity, and development.
 Creating this piece helped me understand how structure and freedom can work together within a composition. After I made this piece, I became more confident in myself to balance
 chaos with intention while trusting my instincts as an artist. This artwork reflects how art has helped me grow more comfortable with navigating uncertainty, both in a creative and
 personal way.

   font-style: normal;">Conclusion</h2>
 <p>Upon reflection, art has had a lasting and transformative impact on my college experience here at UNCG by shaping how I think, communicate, cope, and grow. Each project taught me 
 something different, whether it was self-reflection, visual communication, experimentation, or personal resilience. Art pushed me to slow down, take more risks, and see challenges
 in a different light as opportunities for creative problem-solving. Throughout these experiences, both hard and easy, I developed a greater sense of confidence in myself and a stronger
 sense of identity. Because I majored in art, it's no longer just another subject to me, it's a meaningful part of how I understand myself and engage with the world around me.
